# Circuitscan

Circuitscan is a circuit verifier explorer. Like verified contracts, a verified circuit verifier allows users to interact with applications directly if the frontend becomes unusable as well as ensures that the deployed source code matches the expected source code. Developers use a CLI to submit their circom sources to the verification server just like how Hardhat and Foundry submit deployed contracts to Etherscan. The frontend catalogs all verified submissions with source code and proving keys available for usage.

> [!NOTE]
> While the demo at [`circuitscan.clonk.me`](https://circuitscan.clonk.me) still works, it has been replaced with a new site at [`circuitscan.org`](https://circuitscan.org).
